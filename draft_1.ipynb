    "One can choose numerous potential energy functions. These describe how the (relative) positions of particles affect the energy of the system. Because we are running a Langevin integrator which is grounded in Newtonian dynamics, we care about forces and their effects on momenta. However, it is often convenient to keep track of potentials, as they are usually relatively simple functions of the position vector of a system. Depending on the integrator used, many scientific applications allow you to design potentials symbolically, eg `Spring_Potential = ''0.5*k*x^2''`. These integrators then have tables, or symbolic differentiators, to differentiate the potential into a force. This project won't attempt to do that; instead, I'll build functions that get $U$ and $\\nabla U$ directly depending on the type of potential specified. "

    "Perhaps the simplest potential is a harmonic potential, $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2.$ Observe that $-D_xU = F_x = -kx $, where the subscript $x$ denotes the x component or differentiating in the $x$ direction. For our harmonic potentials, we can imagine a spring between each pair of particles. We thus sum the pairwise potentials for each bead: $$U_{\\mathrm{sys}} = \\sum_{i < j}\\frac{1}{2}k||q_i-q_j||^2 = \\frac{1}{2}k \\sum_{i<j}||q_i-q_j||^2.$$ To take the gradient, we differentiate wrt each component of $q$: $$(\\nabla U)_i = D_{q_i}U = \\frac{1}{2}k\\sum_{j \\neq i} D_{q_i}||q_i-q_j||^2 = k\\sum_{j \\neq i} (q_i-q_j).$$ We lose most of the terms because they are constant wrt $q_i$, and we lose the magnitude/absolute value at the end because because we can think of this as differentiating $\\mathbf{r} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}$.

    "We often want to simulate a sub-region of a system so that we don't have to consider boundary conditions. This is a good idea, but we run into a conundrum: our goal is to avoid boundaries, and we've just brought our boundaries in closer. The solution is clear: periodic boundary conditions. We use the isometry/ergodicity of our system, and assume we're in a relatively representative sub-box. Then we consider particles that leave off to the right to correspond to particles appearing from the left, and vice-versa. This is the classic dynamic representatino of movement on the 2-torus. The only problem is the following: if particles A and B are adjacent to each other at the boundary and B crosses, suddenly the force between them goes to 0. The solution to this problem is the minimum-image convention (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_boundary_conditions)."

    "We want to apply B A O A B. In the README.md file attached, we describe these terms in more detail. The important thing to note here is that A depends on p and is applied to q, while B depends on q and is applied to p. The beauty of BAOAB is that it allows us to freeze q wrt p and p wrt q for the A and B steps by examining variable-specific flows. Hence, integrating these operations over dt is equivalent to integrating a constant. In particular, we have $$\\int \\frac{dq}{dt}dt = \\int \\frac{p}{M}dt \\implies \\Delta q = \\Delta t\\frac{p}{M} $$ with a similar result for $B$. However, the $O$ operation is applied to $p$ and depends on $p$. We have $$\\int \\frac{dp}{dt} = \\int -\\gamma p + \\xi(t) \\sqrt{2\\gamma k_B Tm} \\ dt.$$ Letting $\\sigma = \\sqrt{2\\gamma k_B Tm}$ and $\\xi(t)dt = W_t$, a vector of $N$ independent Wiener processes. Then we use a technique common in the soft sciences (physics, eg.) and multiply by $e^{\\gamma t}$ to get $$\\begin{aligned}  d(e^{\\gamma t}p) = \\gamma e^{\\gamma t}p dt + e^{\\gamma t}dp = \\gamma e^{\\gamma t}pdt + e^{\\gamma t}(-\\gamma p dt + \\sigma d W_t)  = \\sigma e^{\\gamma t}dW_t \\end{aligned}.$$ We can then integrate as physicists, getting $$   \\int d(e^{\\gamma t}p) = \\sigma \\int e^{\\gamma t} dW_t  \\implies e^{\\gamma (t + dt)}p(t+dt) - e^{\\gamma t}p(t) = \\sigma \\int _t ^{t + dt} e^{\\gamma t} dW_s$$ where the RHS is a bizarre integral over our stochastic function. Then simple algebra gives $$  p(t + dt) = e^{-\\gamma dt}p(t) + \\sigma \\int_t^{t + dt} e^{\\gamma (s-t-dt)}dW_s.$$"

Unfortunately, `1-((e**x)**2)` is quite numerically unstable; for very small (on the order of dt) x, `e**x` can get uncomfortably close to 1; squaring can become a mess, and then you risk catestrophic cancellation subtracting two numbers close to 1.
